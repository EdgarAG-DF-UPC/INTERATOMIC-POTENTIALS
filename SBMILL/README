Vladimir Sladek,   Lukáš Bučinský,   Ján Matuška,   Michal Ilčin,   Vladimír Lukeša  and  Viliam Laurinca   (SBMILL) Potential Files (see https://doi.org/10.1039/C4CP02241F [a])

OPTION 1:
=========
Compilation: gfortran Sladek.corr.f -o s.x
===========
Executable: s.x
========== 
Run: ./s.x

Different versions of the SBMILL Pb-He interatomic potential[a] are generated as tables in LAMMPS format:
# dU[TQ]Z --> PbHe.dUTQZ.table
# dU[DT]Z --> PbHe.dUDTZ.table
# dU[DTQ]Z --> PbHe.dUDTQZ.table

Several files corresponding to the first version ( dU[TQ]Z ) multiplied by a linear coupling parameter (0 < λ < 1) are also created, to be used in a discretized particle insertion process.

This version creates a SINGLE table for Pb-He pair interactions, which is the sum of the two following contributions:
    (i) an artificial exponential repulsive / attractive term, V_i (r) = λ * A * exp(- r / B) = A * exp(- r / B + λ');
    (ii) a coupled Pb-He potential, V_ii (r) = ξ * V_PbHe(r).
Notes:
    # A = 12.483 eV, B = 1 Å .
    # V_PbHe(r) corresponds to the real Pb-He interaction of Sladek et al. [a] .
    # λ, ξ are two independent coupling parameters, which must be indicated as input values when the program is executed
    (introduce the two values in a single line separated by one or several spaces).
    # The first parameter can be used as both a repulsive interaction (λ > 0) and an attractive interaction (λ < 0).
    The limiting case λ = 0 (i.e. λ'-->-infty) corresponds to the case in which this term is deactivated.
    Example:
        * It can be used to grow a cavity in an existing system.
        * In the case that He is hosted in a LiPb mixture, -infty < λ' < -2 is a good choice. 
    # The second coupling parameter should be 0 <= ξ <= 1.
    Limiting cases:
        * ξ = 0: absence of real Pb-He interactions.
        * ξ = 1: the real Pb-He interactions are totally included.
