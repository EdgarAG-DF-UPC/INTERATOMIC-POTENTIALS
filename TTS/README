Compilation: make clean tts.file.x
===========
Executable: tts.file.x
==========
Run: ./tts.file.x < TTS.INPUT
===

* TTS.INPUT is the input file to generate the He-X interaction potential, which must contain a the list of elements X:
--> He
--> Li
--> Na
--> K#
--> Rb
--> Cs
** NOTE: the element X must have 2 characters!

* It will be generated several lambda-scaled potentials (lambda ranging from 0 to 1).
  They can be moved to the directories X-He using the command "make move".

* The file "table2" contains the star quantities in TTS model for H–H, H–He and He–He (See Table 2 of Ref.[2]).

He-alkali interactions use those star quantities of H-He with 4 parameters De, Re, ZA, ZB included in the main code.
Tritium is essentially a hydrogen: "Note that T can be modeled as its isotope hydrogen (H) here because T and H have the same electronic structure. In the following, we will only refer to H." (See Ref.[c])
